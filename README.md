# Impacts on Society

The AP Computer Science Principles course is the first computer science class that I am planning to implement at the Academy of Careers and Exploration High School. The prerequisite to this course will be Algebra 1; thus opening up the course to students primarily in 10th to 12th grade, although there are quite a few 9th graders who are enrolled in Geometry, making them also eligible for the class. This course does not require students to have prior experience in computer programming as it is a first-time introduction to computer science. In addition to learning and applying the core principles of computer science, we would like to encourage students to implement computational thinking practices, including learning to become informed, responsible users of technology. 
Our AP Computer Science Principles course will be offered through the curriculum available on CodeHS.org. According to the course overview provided by CodeHS, several of the overarching goals of the course are to “explain the impact computing has on society, economy, and culture; [and to] learn to be informed and responsible users of technology.”  Since this course is based on the College Board AP Computer Science Principles Framework, it incorporates Practice P6, Responsible Computing, where the main course objective is to “contribute to an inclusive, safe, collaborative, and ethical computing culture.” It focuses on five big ideas that are foundational for the computer science field. Big Idea 5 specifically addresses “Impact of Computing.” The description for Big Idea 5 is as follows: “Computers and computing have revolutionized our lives. To use computing safely and responsibly, we need to be aware of privacy, security, and ethical issues. As programmers, we need to understand how our programs will be used and be responsible for the consequences. As computer users, we need to understand how to protect ourselves and our privacy when using a computer.”
Within the existing curriculum, the AP Computer Science Principles course has several units that incorporate Practice P6 and Big Idea 5. These units are Unit Three “Programming with JavaScript”; Unit 11 “The Internet”; Unit 12 Practice Performance Task  “The Effects of the Internet”; Unit 15 Project “The Impacts of Computing”;  and Unit 18 “Creative Development.” 


## Plan

### Learning Objectives

The learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts will focus on incorporating Practice P6 and Big Idea 5 from the College Board AP Computer Science Principles Framework. Assignments that relate to social impacts are found in five different units in the AP Computer Science Principles course. 

Unit Three: Programming with JavaScript
- Students will explain why programming is an important skill that can be useful
- Students will explain ways that programs are being used today
- Students will research and analyze the positive and negative effects of programs
- Students will communicate their information and analyses to their classmates

Unit Three: Programming with JavaScript and Unit Fifteen Project: Impact of Computing

- Students will communicate their information and analyses to their classmates

Unit Eleven: The Internet
- Students will understand what the Internet is and how it works
- Students will analyze how the Internet impacts their lives
- Students will define what the digital divide is and analyze their immediate environment, such as school and community, discuss if and how it applies to their situation
- Students will discuss the issue of anonymity its positive and negative implications
- Students will research, understand, and discuss the legal and ethical concerns that surround Internet censorship

- Students will learn and discuss the impact of cybercrime
- Students will learn how to counter cybercrime with cybersecurity and cryptography
- Students will learn and research practical measures to take to improve their security on the Internet
- Students will communicate their information and analyses to their classmates

Unit Twelve: The Effects of the Internet
- Students will select an Internet-based computing innovation 
- Students will develop a computational artifact (graphic, animation, video, program, or audio recording) to communicate and help classmates learn about their Internet-based computing innovation of choice
- Students will explain the innovation’s purpose and function
- Students will explain the innovation’s potential impacts, positive and negative, on society, economy, and culture
- Students will analyze any ethical implications of the Internet-based innovation
- Students will identify and discuss any data privacy, security issues, or storage concerns associated with the Internet-based innovation

Unit 18: Creative Development
- Students will learn and understand the design thinking process based on the strategies developed at the Stanford D School
- Students will apply the design thinking process and cycle to create a program that addresses a problem of interest
- Students will build a prototype, test the prototype through user experience to develop improved iterations of their program
- Students will optimize their program by reflecting on diverse perspectives gained from user feedback during testing 
- Students will reflect, discuss, and present human biases associated with the program they developed
- Students will reflect, discuss, and present any legal and ethical concerns associated with the program they developed


### Learning Activities

The learning activities in each unit will be diverse. Typically each unit will start with an introductory video that introduces the big idea concept. The video will be followed by a short assessment quiz. In order to explore the concept further, students may be presented with case studies to read, discuss, and answer questions about; or a programming assignment that applies the concept that is being discussed. Most units culminate with a larger project or performance task that is designed to apply the concepts learned while fostering the students’ creative and innovative mind. Students will also be presenting their projects to the class. The class will have the opportunity to critique or discuss various aspects of the project, especially as it relates to negative and/or positive impacts on society.. All student work will be compiled into a portfolio.

### Assessment

Throughout the course, students will be collecting artifacts for their portfolio as they complete each unit. The learning activities weigh heavily on students actively participating to show that they are meeting the learning objectives. Students are given ample opportunities to reflect on their learning by answering questions. These artifacts give insight to what the student is thinking regarding the various topics. Furthermore, student learning activities involve ample discussion. Active participation in discussion not only assesses knowledge of the subject matter, but also reveals how the students have reflected upon that knowledge

### Outcomes

Students have ample opportunity to discuss and share ideas and knowledge they gained through research. They also have ample opportunity to reflect on how computing innovations are beneficial, or harmful, to themselves as well as the community around them. They are also given the opportunity to explore the digital divide. I believe that this will help broaden their thinking and focus more attention to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
